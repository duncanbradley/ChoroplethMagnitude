Dent doesn’t mention displaying magnitude

In this experiment, values were almost the same but were subtly different. Using a breaking algorithm would have obscured this message. Using an unclassified color scheme is therefore most appropriate. 

Color discrimination ability in choropleth maps (Brychtova & Coltekin). Asking participants to detect differences between two areas. Becuase the goal is being able to distinguish between colors. Determined the minimum color distance that would allow people to reliably detect differences between non-neighbouring regions.

Though our map may not conform to these best practices, none of these best practices are trying to convey magnitude.

Extending the legend to incorporate values won’t be appropriate for every task

Whilst we know that legends help people see values are largeR or smalleR, these judgements are in relation to other plotted values. We demonstrate that they can affect whether people see values as large or small, in the absence of contrasting values on the map. Absolute vs. relative
