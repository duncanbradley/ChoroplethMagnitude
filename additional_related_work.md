Work on legends in thematic maps
The role of legends for developing an initial understanding, with fixation on map legends decreasing as exposure to map increased (Hepburn et al. 2021). Demonstrates building up of a cognitive representation of that information.

In keeping with left-hemisphere specialised language processing, legends presented on the right are processed more quickly than those on the left. 
Li and Qin - investigated visual search performance in legends, with a focus on formatting. Following Gestalt principles, proximity between icons and corresponding text was the most influential aspect of spacing. 
Gołębiowska - simple task performance was similar across all three legend arrangements (list legend, grouped legend, natural legend), but user preferences depend on legends’ suitability for specific tasks.
Dykes et al illustrate several creative ways of designing map legends, e.g. using information visualisation techniques such as bar chart or treemap, dynamic legends showing only relevant information, illustrating that conventional implemetations are not the only options.  
Choropleth maps outperformed maps with graduated symbols and isoline maps in a range of basic tasks, and were also participnats’ preferred option (Słomska-Przech and Gołębiowska (2021)
There have been various other attemps to design alternative legends (e.g. ogive-based, Cromley and Ye; histogram-based, Kumar; uncertainty-capturing, Rechtless and Brewer). However, all of these have used the entire range of the data. 

Different datasets suit different mapping methods. 

A big focus of legend design has been on data classification. To better display patterns of data, values are classified into groups, and these groups are chosen in order to optimise the display. The divisions between distinct colors are known as ‘breaks’. Enhance the communicative ability of the plot. Create a more ‘balanced’ assignment of colours and values. Many different algorithms have been developed to select appropriate breaks for a given data set. 

In this experiment, values were almost the same but were subtly different. Using a breaking algorithm would have obscured this message. Using an unclassified color scheme is therefore most appropriate. 

Even simple patterns can benefit from visualisation (e.g., steady rise in global temperature, ). We don’t just visualise things that can’t be summed up in a sentence. We visualise them for memorability, dramatic effect, expressiveness, for low literacy, rhetoric, see also Bertini et al scatterplots.
